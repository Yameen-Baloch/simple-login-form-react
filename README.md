Hello, This is a simple login form created using the React, react Hooks and the spread operator.
Spread operator is just like a three dots(...) but it works very fine....

# Sprear Oprtaor
The three dots (â€¦) notation referred to as the Spread syntax has been part of React for a long time when it could be used via transpilation, although, it has been made a part of JavaScript as part of the ES2015 syntax.

The Spread syntax is used to deconstruct an array or object into separate variables where the exact number of elements in the array may not be known or when we wish to keep an attribute or a set of attributes separate from the entire object.


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
